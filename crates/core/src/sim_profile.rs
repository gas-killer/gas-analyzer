//! Simulation environment profiles for Gas Killer execution.
//!
//! A [`SimProfile`] pins the EVM environment a tracked function is simulated
//! under. `Chain` mirrors the real chain (today's behaviour everywhere).
//! `Unbounded` is the Gas Killer *unbounded execution* profile: the tracked
//! function is simulated with gas limits far above any real block, so
//! arbitrarily heavy Solidity can be executed off-chain — provided the payload
//! it produces still fits in one on-chain transaction (see
//! [`validate_unbounded_cost`]).
//!
//! The constraint is *priced*, not counted: what has to stay bounded is the gas
//! needed to apply the diff, so a transition may write as many slots as fit
//! under [`UNBOUNDED_PAYLOAD_GAS_BUDGET`]. Consumers whose state is too large
//! for that can commit it into fewer slots — in the limit, the single-slot
//! commitment pattern (solidity-sdk PR #51) — but that pattern is an option for
//! contracts that need it, not a requirement of this mode.
//!
//! # Determinism is protocol-critical
//!
//! The profile's limits are **pinned protocol constants**, not tunables.
//! Every party that re-executes a tracked function must use bit-identical
//! environment overrides:
//!
//! 1. operators, when extracting the state-update payload they sign;
//! 2. this analyzer, when simulating on a user's behalf;
//! 3. the SP1 slashing guest (`docs/SP1_REVM_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md`), when a
//!    slasher re-executes the original function inside the zkVM to prove the
//!    signed updates wrong.
//!
//! If the guest ran with the real header's `gas_limit` while operators
//! simulated under lifted limits, a heavy-but-honest execution would OOG in
//! the guest and produce a *different* update set — falsely slashing honest
//! operators. Conversely, per-operator ad-hoc limits would make quorum
//! signatures diverge on the boundary. So the constants below are a pinned
//! protocol value, not a tuning knob: changing them changes what honest
//! operators produce, and must be rolled out fleet-wide in lockstep with the
//! slashing guest — never as a silent edit.
//!
//! Calldata note: neither revm nor the EVM protocol caps calldata *size*;
//! calldata is bounded only through intrinsic gas (EIP-7623 floor pricing).
//! Lifting the gas limits therefore lifts the effective calldata bound too —
//! multi-megabyte witnesses (e.g. the expanded state behind a single-slot
//! commitment) simulate fine under `Unbounded` even though they could never
//! land in a real transaction. Only the *signed payload* must fit on-chain.
